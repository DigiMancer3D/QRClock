# QRClock
Algorithmically Controlled Data Clock with QR Output Capabilities
</br></br>
## QRs can be so specific that people could use them as a clock
<hr>
</br>
That's the main perspective that started this build but since then the clock has becaome more about determining very specfic points of data simply off the UTC of the viewer.
</br></br>
There's tons of points of data displayed directly on the clock face allwoing the user to determine as close as the 1/8th hour without knowing the exact time amoung other things.

Algorithmically Faked-Data Clock

## Why not have a seemingly real clock for game timing?
</br></br>
### This still runs off the principle that there are ways to have a clock face without saying the time and still display tons of information without text/words.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This clock shows that you could use the algos within to handle various concepts for websites, webapps and games alike. The algos within handle the following series of events:
