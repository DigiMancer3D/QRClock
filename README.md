# QRClock
Algorithmically Controlled Data Clock with QR Output Capabilities
</br></br>
## QRs can be so specific that people could use them as a clock
<hr>
</br>
That's the main perspective that started this build but since then the clock has becaome more about determining very specfic points of data simply off the UTC of the viewer.
</br></br>
There's tons of points of data displayed directly on the clock face allwoing the user to determine as close as the 1/8th hour without knowing the exact time amoung other things.
